In order to run, call compare_test.py; this will compare 3 different methods of calculating the Laplacian on a domain defined in problem.cfg. Alternatively, the individual directories contain the individual methods for inspection.

Running compare_test.py will drop various stats from 10 runs of each method into a csv file in the test results directory.
